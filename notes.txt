How will schedule fluctuate for a doctor using our product
How many patients will need to be in backlog to see change
How often will we need to ping patients for an appointment


pivot table would show:
Name
Time of offer
Slot that was offered
Offer type
Offer value
Offer answer
Unsubscribes?
Speed at which offer was filled, which changes as we open min time to cancel window and increase number
 of people texted at same time

a patient experience report
    # each patient's name
    # communication they received, in order
    # response to each (refused, OK, etc)

Slot fill report:
# slot time
# time when changed
# status to which it changed

Each class:
- stores interesting data about itself in instances
- has a function to surface each data, as granularly as possible
- reports only a single item (that's expected to be printed on one line). recipient should not have to unpack.

data > format data > feed to report > assemble report > format report

report format has
it's own file
column names (and implied order)
report shouldn't have to know data type of data coming up, but it should be able to ask for a certain format
(except time, so it can be formatted all together)

get_flat_data
[{name} {response},
{name} {response},
{name} {response},]

sheet
get next column_name
case column name:
    get name
case response
    get response




#TODO
# make bigben class for time uniformity
# Add true life cycle

bben takes functions that call patients for responses. each call is prescribed to
occur at a certain time, or interval
bb makes sure that the calls go out at the proper time by iterating over all
calls every minute, and executing the ones that meet their time condition
when a patient is called.
